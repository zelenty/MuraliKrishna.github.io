# SEO Changes Applied

- Added meta title and description to head for SEO.
- Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social preview.
- Added JSON-LD Person schema for better knowledge graph results.
- Ensured an H1 on pages that lacked one.
- Added alt attributes to 1 image tags (where missing).
- Generated sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

If you want further refinements (custom OG image, keyword optimization, content rewrite), reply and I will update accordingly.
